"""A valence probe: a ridge-regression head on frozen CLAP audio embeddings.

Motivation
----------
The main evaluation (evaluate.py) judges a mood edit two ways: CLAP's 5-way
mood argmax (transfer_success) and chroma preservation. The mood argmax is
coarse — it only tells you which of five buckets an edit landed in. This probe
adds a *continuous valence axis* so we can ask a sharper question: did the edit
move the audio's positivity (valence) in the intended direction, and by how
much?

Valence is the harder affective axis to read from audio (mode/harmony carry it,
and DEAM's valence labels are noisier than its arousal labels), so a per-song
prediction is only moderately accurate. But as an aggregate metric over many
edits, even a noisy-but-unbiased probe reliably detects a *shift in the mean*,
which is exactly the "did mood transfer, on the whole" question we care about.

Design
------
  frozen CLAP audio embedding (D-dim, L2-normed)  ->  ridge head  ->  valence
                                                      (fit on DEAM valence)

  * Regression, not classification: DEAM valence is continuous in [-1, 1];
    we keep it continuous and only threshold/aggregate afterward.
  * Ridge (L2) is essential because the embedding dim (~512) is comparable to
    or larger than the number of training songs (p >= n), so an unregularized
    fit would overfit badly. lambda is chosen by held-out R^2.
  * The probe MUST be reported with its held-out R^2 / correlation. If that is
    near zero, the valence-shift metric it produces is noise and should be
    disregarded — mirroring how evaluate.py validates CLAP before trusting it.

Caveat: the probe reuses CLAP embeddings, so it shares CLAP's blind spots with
evaluate.py's existing CLAP metric — it is a sharper readout on the same
representation, not a fully independent judge.
